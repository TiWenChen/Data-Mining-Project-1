# Data-Mining-Project-1

This is a project of Data Mining course in the National Taiwan University. The mission is to predict the house prices in Taipei and New Taipei. In this project, I use a two-stage ML method to capture the hidden state which is relevant to the house prices. The two-stage ML method improves the prediction accuarcy significantly in both training and testing dataset.
